description: 'Coming soon...


  The International Brain lab (IBL) aims to understand the neural basis of decision-making
  in the mouse by gathering a whole-brain activity map composed of electrophysiological
  recordings pooled from multiple laboratories. We have systematically recorded from
  nearly all major brain areas with Neuropixels probes, using a grid system for unbiased
  sampling and replicating each recording site in at least two laboratories. These
  data have been used to construct a brain-wide map of activity at single-spike cellular
  resolution during a decision-making task. In addition to the map, this data set
  contains other information gathered during the task: sensory stimuli presented to
  the mouse; mouse decisions and response times; and mouse pose information from video
  recordings and DeepLabCut analysis.'
